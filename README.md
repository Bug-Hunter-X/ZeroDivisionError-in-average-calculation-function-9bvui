This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `calculate_average` function attempts to compute the average of a list of numbers, but it doesn't handle the edge case of an empty list.  This results in division by zero, causing a runtime error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this error by checking if the list is empty before performing the calculation.
